- ⏳ Create devices API layer
- ⏳ Create devices types
- ⏳ Update imports

#### Scenes Feature

- ⏳ Move Scenes.tsx to features/scenes
- ⏳ Split into UI/Container components
- ⏳ Create scenes API layer
- ⏳ Create scenes types
- ⏳ Update imports

#### Shared Components

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

- ⏳ Add tests for auth feature

## 🎯 Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Migrate Rooms Feature** - This is the main page
2. **Migrate Devices Feature** - Used by Room page
3. **Migrate Scenes Feature** - Used by Rooms page
4. **Update Pages** - Wire up the actual implementations
5. **Add CSS Classes** - Replace inline styles
6. **Add Tests** - Start with auth feature
7. **Add Storybook Stories** - Document UI components

## 📝 Notes

- Build is working ✅
- Path aliases configured ✅
- Auth feature fully migrated to new architecture ✅
- Design tokens system in place ✅
- TypeScript strict mode enabled ✅
- All old files still exist in `/components` folder (not deleted yet)
- Can run both old and new code side-by-side during migration

## 🚀 How to Continue

Run the development server to test:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run tests (when added):

```bash
npm run test
```
